abstract="Detecting anomalies in satellite telemetry data is pivotal in ensuring its safe operations. Although there exist various data-driven techniques for the task of determining abnormal parts of the signal, they are virtually never validated over real telemetries. Analyzing such data is challenging due to its intrinsic characteristics, as telemetry may be noisy and affected by incorrect acquisition, resulting in missing parts of the signal. In this paper, we tackle this issue and propose a machine learning approach for detecting anomalies in single-channel satellite telemetry. To validate its capabilities in a practical scenario, we build a dataset capturing the nominal and anomalous telemetry data captured on board OPS-SAT---a nanosatellite launched and operated by the European Space Agency. Our extensive experimental study showed that the proposed algorithm offers high-quality anomaly detection in real-life satellite telemetry, reaching 98.4{\%} accuracy over the unseen test set.",
